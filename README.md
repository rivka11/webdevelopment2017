# webdevelopment2017
This is my introduction to web development using PHP. I followed an online course at Touro College to create this website. Every semester the walls are covered with signs for selling and buying old textbooks, so I chose to design a website which can connect people selling textbooks, which can hopefully make the process easier for both buyers and sellers.
